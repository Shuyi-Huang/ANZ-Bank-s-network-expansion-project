# ANZ Bank's network expansion project

Background

ANZ Bank is extending its network by establishing new branches in various locations. This expansion requires a robust and secure network infrastructure to support daily banking operations and enhance customer service. The network ensures high availability, security, and scalability to meet the bank's future needs.


Abstract

This report presents the design and implementation of ANZ Bank's network expansion project, focusing on the establishment of a secure, reliable, and scalable network infrastructure to support the bank's operations across new remote sub-banks in Sydney, Darwin, and Perth. The project encompasses the development of the HQ LAN, Remote1 LAN, and Remote2 LAN (IoT), each tailored to meet specific operational requirements and enhance the bank's service delivery.
This project applied practical networking skills such as network design, IP addressing, VLAN configuration, and basic security planning to simulate a real-world enterprise banking environment. The goal was to create a scalable, safe, and efficient network solution that meets the operational needs of a large financial organisation like ANZ Bank.
