# ANZ Bank's network expansion project

The ANZ Bank Network Expansion Project focuses on designing and improving the bank’s network infrastructure to support business growth and better service delivery.
The project involves planning secure and reliable network connections between different branches, ensuring stable communication, data protection, and efficient system performance.

Through this project applied practical networking skills such as network design, IP addressing, VLAN configuration, and basic security planning to simulate a real-world enterprise banking environment. The goal was to create a scalable, safe, and efficient network solution that meets the operational needs of a large financial organisation like ANZ Bank.
